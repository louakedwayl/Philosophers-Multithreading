Here are the key things you need to know to succeed in this assignment:
• One or more philosophers sit at a round table.
There is a large bowl of spaghetti in the middle of the table.
• The philosophers take turns eating, thinking, and sleeping.
While they are eating, they are not thinking nor sleeping;
while thinking, they are not eating nor sleeping;
and, of course, while sleeping, they are not eating nor thinking.
• There are also forks on the table. There are as many forks as philosophers.
• Since eating spaghetti with just one fork is impractical, a philosopher must pick up
both the fork to their right and the fork to their left before eating.
• When a philosopher has finished eating, they put their forks back on the table and
start sleeping. Once awake, they start thinking again. The simulation stops when
a philosopher dies of starvation.
• Every philosopher needs to eat and should never starve.
• Philosophers do not communicate with each other.
• Philosophers do not know if another philosopher is about to die.
• Needless to say, philosophers should avoid dying!
